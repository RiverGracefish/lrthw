>I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

  Yes, it is necessary if you want the correct output. If just type 4 instead of 4.0, it will round up the floating point.

>Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.

>Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

>Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.

>Remember that _ is an underscore character.

>Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
